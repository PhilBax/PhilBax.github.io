## About This Site

The goal of this site is to share solutions to interesting problems I come across, quality-of-life improvements I discover or develop, and interesting tools and ideas I learn about. It will likely focus on UE4 development in Linux, as that's what I'm actively working on.

I wrote one blog post on gamasutra.com, but their blog tools are really hard to work with. After briefly considering Medium, I found out about [GitHub's site-hosting](https://pages.github.com/), and decided to go that route.

The site uses the Jekyll processing built into GitHub, and makes use of the excellent [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write blog posts and upload to GitHub.

## About Me

![Profile]({{ "/assets/ProfilePic.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I started programming when I was 10, learning from library books, and using QBasic on our family's P90 computer. From there, I taught myself C and C++ (an ongoing process). I have some experience with Java and C#, and I find I really enjoy Python.

In 2005, I started working part-time at Redstone Arsenal, developing training software and simulators based on the America's Army PC game. I gained experience in a wide range of systems, including weapons and ballistics, vehicle physics, AI, UI, input device, tools, and network code. If you want a behind-the-scenes peek at some of the fun glitches and bugs I ran into, check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIahXMamYcMh2QDTvlV9Kxg).

In 2007, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and took a full-time position at the Army Game Studio, contracting through SAIC.

I was able to put this experience to use in helping wrap up development on America's Army 3 in 2009, and I learned a lot more in the process. There's a big difference between working on trainers in a LAN environment and a video game in an internet environment!

When we started America's Army: Proving Grounds, I initially headed up the weapons and attachments code. As time went on, and people shifted away from the project, I got to touch more and more systems. Eventually, I became Lead Programmer on the project, and took over management of our build servers and distribution path. I was able to reduce our build times by over half, and our average patch size on Steam from ~1.2GB to around 300MB.

Towards the end of my work on the PC game, I worked on porting the game to other platforms. I did some work on the Mac port, which we nearly finished, but couldn't get the performance where we wanted it. I also worked on porting the server to Linux. Once we got cleared to port to PS4, I worked on a lot of the matchmaking and server management code.

My work on the Mac and PS4 was my first deep dive into Unreal's rendering code -- something that had intimidated me for years!

In 2018, I parted ways with the Army Game Studio, and took a position with Torch Technologies. I'm currently developing scene generators in Unreal Engine 4, which is putting my more recent experience with Linux and Unreal's rendering code to use. I'm also gaining a lot of experience with Git.
