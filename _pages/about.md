## About This Site

The goal of this site is to share solutions to interesting problems I come across, quality-of-life improvements I discover or develop, and interesting tools and ideas I learn about. It will likely focus on UE4 development in Linux, as that's what I'm actively working on.

I wrote one blog post on gamasutra.com, but their blog tools are really hard to work with. After briefly considering Medium, I found out about [GitHub's site-hosting](https://pages.github.com/), and decided to go that route.

The site uses the Jekyll processing built into GitHub, and makes use of the excellent [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write blog posts and upload to GitHub.

## About Me

![Profile]({{ "/assets/ProfilePic.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I started programming when I was 10, learning from library books, and using QBasic on our family's P90 computer. From there, I taught myself C and C++ (an ongoing process). I have some experience with Java and C#, and I'm finding I really enjoy Python.

I've been a professional programmer since 2005. Initially, I developed training and simulation software based on the America's Army PC game. I gained experience in a wide range of systems, including weapons and ballistics, vehicle physics, AI, UI, input device, tools, and network code. If you want a behind-the-scenes peek at some of the fun glitches I ran into and easter eggs I made, check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIahXMamYcMh2QDTvlV9Kxg).

In 2009, I put my programming experience to work helping wrap up development on America's Army 3. A couple of years later, we started America's Army: Proving Grounds. Towards the end of my work on the PC game, I worked on porting the game to other platforms. I did some work on the Mac port, which we nearly finished, but couldn't get the performance where we wanted it. I also worked on porting our server code to Linux. Once we got the go-ahead to port the game to PS4, I worked on some of the matchmaking and server management code, in addition to some rendering and performance work.

The Mac and PS4 work was my first deep dive into Unreal's rendering code -- something that had intimidated me for years! I got to dig into shaders, look at Epic's OpenGL renderer, and play with Sony's rendering tools.

In 2018, I parted ways with the Army Game Studio, and took a position with Torch Technologies. I'm currently developing scene generators in Unreal Engine 4, which is putting my Linux and Unreal rendering experience to good use. I've also gained a lot of experience with Git.
